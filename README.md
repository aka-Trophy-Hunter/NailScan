Nail Condition Analyzer
This project tackles nail health assessment in two stages:

Classifying nail diseases from images
Segmenting the affected region of the nail to estimate how severe the condition is

Disease Classification
The starting point was the approach described in Han et al. 2018, which I used as a baseline and then improved on using aggressive data augmentation techniques (cutout and mixup) to boost accuracy beyond the original results. To further validate the model, I evaluated it on an independent test set of European nail images collected from the web. The final model, an ensemble of EfficientNet-B5 and ResNet-152 — performs strongly at the binary task of separating healthy nails from diseased ones. Pinpointing the exact disease, however, remains a harder problem.

Severity Segmentation
For the second stage, I trained a YOLOv5x-Segmentation model to localize the specific area of the nail impacted by disease, which serves as a proxy for severity. The model produces reasonably accurate segmentation masks of the affected region.
